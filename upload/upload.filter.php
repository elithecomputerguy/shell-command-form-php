<h2 id="sixtyone">Conclusions:</h2>
<section id="sixtytwo">The &lt;input type=file&gt; is defined in one unified element which consist from three units 
(my tested HTML interpreter) in left-to-right order: First Push Button, Text Label, Last Push Button. 
By specifying the "value" attribute You would be able to change the text value in Last Push Button. For
the rest the Internet could suggest only Hacking Techniques with hidding, minimizing, transparenting and so on.
Does HTML really is Global Leader or just another small tech which does not give proper way to swap languages
in International and utf-8 compatible way? There are many Document Management Systems, so assume there would be
many Hackers who tries to fit the needs of Small-Medium or Enterprise level Organisation. The HTTP Method like
"PUT" is directly associated to the Full Document Integral Transaction (i.e. file object of PNG) from one System 
to another. Tech for putting file from the User to the Server in the HTML and HTTP were already destroyed / never was 
available / is being destroyed from the Public and non-Public needs.</section>
<section id="seventytwo">The name of "Browse..." You should be able to link with the "Internet Browser" term. Previous 
Conclusions shows that such tools are not Perfect. Especially when we have various Programming languages, Applications 
or simply Apps who does not need the HTML and HTTP functionality. Does specifications ever take in consieration the i18n?
</section>
<section id="seventysix">There are Situations especially in the Gaming Industry when big Enterprise Companies Open Sources their Products,
maybe not newest ones, but with the Idea for building Community around the Products which they created. It helps to gain new Ideas 
to see how this Community which are cappable to program will build their Game Solution and would develop it later. There are possibility
that there would be multiple Communities, in this case less programmers would do less development. Nowadays there are Game Theory University 
study modules which could be linked with real life situations with aim to Succeed not in short period of time, but in long run.</section>
<section id="eightyone">By taking in the Account Internationalization and other Translator functionalities, proper Banking Systems 
prohibits the use of Online Translation Services because of various Risks.</section>
<section id="eightythree">If we would think more about this functionality, there could be used Virus and Malware Detection Systems 
which would help to determine, if the File is Infected with Virus and (or) Malware, i.e. from shell_exec conduct the file scan: 
clamscan --log=/tmp/hash.and.results /tmp/temporary.loaded.file. In this case would need own proper Hardware which could be cappable 
to do the proper scans with smallest possible latency for better user exprience.</section>
